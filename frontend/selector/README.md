# Oldcord Selector V3
A selector for old Discord builds. UI design inspired by Discord.

## Why a rewrite?

As the Selector grows, and the plan to eventually turn the current patch system into a full fledged Discord mod on Oldcord, we felt it is appropriate to rewrite the old vanilla JS-based Selector into a React SPA, and also because of a larger part of cleaning up and refactoring/rewriting the codebase.

## Why V3?

The then-current Selector is actually a V2! V2 added support the showing of build changelogs and patch selection. V1 is barebones that only has a build selector.
